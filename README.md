# Speed-Dedector-Project-CSE-SIBA
A speed detection system that identifies vehicle speed using sensors and calculates overspeeding in real time. The project helps monitor traffic, improve road safety, and generate alerts when speed limits are exceeded. Built using core concepts of CSE such as embedded systems, data processing, and automation.
